    "bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day!",
    "who created you": "I was created by Mehak.",
    "what can you do": "I can chat with you, answer questions, and help with information. What would you like to know?",
    "tell me a joke": "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
    "what is the meaning of life": "The meaning of life is a philosophical question. What do you think it is?",
    "what is your favorite color": "As I'm a bot, I don't have preferences, but I think all colors are beautiful!",
    "do you have any hobbies": "I enjoy learning new things and helping people with their questions.",
